  },

    "user": "Yes and it was good again. Might try a different seasoning tomorrow.",

  {
    "user": "Not really. Do you have a recipe for it?",
    "gabby": "Sure do! Just mix together some ground coffee, brown sugar, salt, and a bit of chili powder. Rub it onto the steak and grill as usual."

    "gabby": "Please do! What's your favorite cut? I guess youâ€™d be into ribeye or filet mignon?"
